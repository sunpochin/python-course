(Optional) A Closer Look at Transposed Convolutions
Now that you have an idea of what transposed convolutions are (also commonly referred to as "deconvolutions") and the checkerboard pattern problem that comes with using them, let's take a closer look! This interactive paper demonstrates the checkerboard pattern problem and how they are not exclusive to GANs, but any neural network that employs them.
