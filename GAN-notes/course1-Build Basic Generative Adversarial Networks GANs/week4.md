InstructionsMy submissionDiscussions
In this notebook, you're going to make a conditional GAN in order to generate hand-written images of digits, conditioned on the digit to be generated (the class vector). This will let you choose what digit you want to generate. You'll then do some exploration of the generated images to visualize what the noise and class vectors mean.
